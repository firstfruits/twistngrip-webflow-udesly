### About the (_EarthScrew) Peg_

The _EarthScrew_ peg is a non-corrosive, tough, super strong and easy to use screw in tent peg with many uses. As tent pegs for camping and other outdoor activities. You can use them in the garden or on the sports field or worksite to hold down the guy ropes of awnings and other coverings. Designed to simply screw into the earth using the hand tool or a 3/8″ drive adaptor in a wrench or battery drill. So simple, no more hammering and ending up with bent or broken pegs!  
  
The Twist-n-Grip peworks like a regular screw which is why we nickname it an _EarthScrew_! It is simply screwed in and out of the earth giving you a good secure anchorage point. Use it to hold down tents, bivouacs, shade coverings, awnings, canopies or gazebos. Tie down the trampoline, furniture, pet cage and so many other items. In the garden, use it for young shrub tie downs, secure growing tunnels or pinning weed mat and soil erosion materials it has so many uses. Removal is as easy as insertion, just unscrew it, no more pulling and straining required, simple and easy.

#### Designed in New Zealand

The head of these tough, heavy duty earth screws (Made in New Zealand Tent Pegs) are designed for a 4mm guy rope to be easily clipped into place for a secure fastening. They can be easily removed without heavy pulling and, when required, the peg can be left permanently in place as they won't corrode like steel tent pegs. The guy rope is set closer to the pole or side of tent thus reducing any trip hazard. These heavy duty screw in pegs are designed to be easy to use, screw in and has less ground disturbance on withdrawal. Wind resistance is 35kg making it a stronger anchoring peg than the equivalent ‘knock in’ peg. Tote bags, also made in NZ are available, each tote bag can hold up to six screw in pegs and a NZ made hand tool to make a tent peg set. Tote bags work with a drawstring and are lightweight unlike leather tote bags.

#### Manufactured in New Zealand

Flexible and strong with excellent diversional stability. The pointed tip of the peg helps to pull the peg in as you screw it in and out with little earth disturbance.
